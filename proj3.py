#Arithmetic operators

a = 5
b = 6

# + operator

print(a+b)  #Adds a and b

# - operator

print(a-b)  #Subtracts b from a

# * operator

print(a*b)  #Adds a, b times 

# / operator

print(a/b)  #Quotient when a is divided by b

# % operator

print(a%b)  #Remainder when int(a) is divided by int(b)

# // operator

print(a//b) #Quotient when int(a) is divided by int(b)

# ** operator

print(a**b) #Returns a raised to b




# Comparison operators

# < operator

print(a<b) #Returns True is a is less than b, else False

# > operator

print(a>b) #Returns True if a is greater than b, else False

# <= operator

print(a<=b) #Returns True if a is either less than or equal to b, else False

# >= operator

print(a>=b) #Returns True if a is either greater than or equal to b, else False

# != operator

print(a!=b) #Returns True if a is not equal to b, else False

# == operator

print(a==b) #Returns True if a is equal to b, else False
